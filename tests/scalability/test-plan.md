# Event Planning System Scalability Test Plan

## Objectives
- Determine maximum concurrent users the system can handle
- Identify performance bottlenecks in critical user flows
- Establish baseline performance metrics for future comparison
- Ensure database queries scale with increased data volume
- Verify real-time features work under load

## Key Metrics to Measure
- Response time (average, 95th percentile)
- Throughput (requests per second)
- Error rate
- Database query performance
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)
- Time to first byte (TTFB)

## Test Scenarios
1. User authentication flow
2. Event creation and management
3. Task assignment and updates
4. Document uploads and retrieval
5. Real-time collaboration features
6. Budget management operations
